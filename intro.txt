'Im a Graphic designer and an amateur Type Designer based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I always loved letters and all about them.I've been collecting and sampling Sinhala typography for last few years, I have a degree in Graphic Design from Academy of Design, Colombo with Northumbria University. (And I topped the batch:)

With my final year design project I figured I love designing type than I ever knew. After completing the degree I shortly worked at Mccann Worldwide office in Colombo as an Art Director and now working with Dave Crossland on Google Fonts.

When not designing type, I think about how the concept of open source content and libre graphics software can help the developing world, and work with these guys.
